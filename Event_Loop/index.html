        // What is event loop?
        // The event loop is JavaScript mechanism that handle asynchronous operations.
        // It continuously checks the call stack and task queue,
        // moving function from queue to stack when stack is empty

        // Call Stack:
        // The call stack is where functions are executed. JavaScript executes functions in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order.
        // When a function is called, it’s pushed to the top of the call stack, and when the function execution is completed, it’s popped off the stack.

        // Web APIs (Browser or Node.js APIs):
    //     These are provided by the browser (or Node.js runtime) and allow asynchronous operations, such as setTimeout, DOM events, AJAX requests, etc.
    //     When an asynchronous operation is initiated (e.g., setTimeout or a network request), it is handled by the Web APIs and does not block the call stack.
    //     Once the operation completes, the Web API places the callback (or event) in the callback queue.


    // Callback Queue:
    // This is a queue that stores callback functions that are ready to be executed once the call stack is empty.
    // For example, when a setTimeout operation completes, the callback function is placed in the callback queue.

    console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout 1");
}, 0);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout 2");
}, 0);

console.log("End");

// output:
// Start
// End
// Timeout 1
// Timeout 2
