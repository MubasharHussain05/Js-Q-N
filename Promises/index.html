        // What is Promise in Js?
        // Promise is for eventual completion task. 
        // It is an object in JavaScript.
        // It is a solution of callback hell.

        // It's used to handle asynchronous operations like HTTP requests, file reading, 
        // or any operation that takes time and completes in the future. 
        // A Promise provides a cleaner way to deal with asynchronous code than using callbacks, 
        // especially when you need to chain multiple asynchronous operations.

        // Pending: The initial state, before the operation has completed.
        // Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a result (resolved).
        // Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for failure (error).

        // Resolve and reject are callback provided by js

        const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve("First task completed");
        });

        promise
        .then((result) => {
        console.log(result); // Output: First task completed
        return "Second task completed";
        })
        .then((result) => {
       console.log(result); // Output: Second task completed
       })
       .catch((error) => {
       console.log("Error:", error);
       });
